Hey, we're glad to have you here!

Our purpose is to connect your business and search for the best finds from our local communities.

Sanayon is an online marketplace that cater services for the people by providing locally produced products from
small-medium businesses. It aims to build an online community by linking buyers directly to local producers. The app
allows shoppers especially from Rinconada Areas to purchase their daily needs, hassle-free.


How Sanayon started

Sanayon at first was just a 'what if' from the 'need to do' project of the owners as senior level students with Bachelor
of Science in Entrepreneurship. The project was intended to be a practice for them as future entrepreneurs. At such,
when they thought about how business and community should compliment each other in achieving collective goals, the young
and perceptive owners concluded with the concept of Sanayon. The owners were able to apply their individual skills to
create the concept from the ground up. More so, share awareness to their advocacies such as sustainable livelihood and
responsible exchange.


The future we look out for with you

We wanted to visualize a progressive and harmonious trading environment within our local communities through this
venture. Our vision is to be a top-tier online marketplace in Rinconada which boosts the local economy and its
communities, through patronizing locally produced products.


A goal is accomplished by linking pieces of actions together,
and we are here to do the work

We want to execute our creativity and enthusiasm as youths of this generation by curating a path for other people,
starting from our engagement in projects like this. Our mission is by integrating technology with viable solutions to
boost the local economy and achieve sustainability, by providing a market of cost-effective, ecological and local-made
products; extensive opportunities for startups and small enterprises; and viable labor potentials for the local
community.

"Sanayon is a special shot for me as a young entrepreneur and a person who has quirks for learning new things. It was a
challenge creating the whole idea from the get-go, but I can say now that it's worth it. I hope you continuously support
our venture and advocacies, and let's each do our best to lift up our own communities. Mabalos po!"

Justin Joy De Los Poyos, Co-founder
"Developing this concept was never been easy as you need patience, courage and hard work to keep you going. We hope that
by using this platform, everyone will be encouraged to support local produce in order to strengthen the economy and to
gain market share in the growing online communities. Our goal is to support them, reclaim customers, and recover from
the pandemic's effects. So we took the risk because if no one will try, who will be? "
